Apart from an intro animate.css flourish, this is a vanilla JS implementation of rock-paper-scissors.  

The idea was for the computer character (Godzilla) to play the way a bad human player plays, meaning they make the same play again on the next turn if they win this turn. In this way, it is meant to be a trainer game to improve the human player's real-life Rock-Paper-Scissors skills.
